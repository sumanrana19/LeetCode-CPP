# LeetCode Solutions in C++

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, all implemented in C++. Each solution is organized by problem category or topic, and the file names follow the problem numbers and titles for easier navigation.

## üìë Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- Each problem is solved in C++ and stored as an individual `.cpp` file.
- The file names follow the format: `ProblemNumber-ProblemTitle.cpp`. For example: `001-TwoSum.cpp`.

## üîç Problem Categories

You will find solutions from various LeetCode categories, including but not limited to:

- **Arrays & Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Binary Trees**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graphs**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Backtracking**
- **Sorting & Searching**
  
## üöÄ Getting Started

To run any solution locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/sumanrana19/LeetCode-CPP.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the folder containing the problem you're interested in.
3. Compile the C++ file using a compiler such as `g++`:
    ```bash
    g++ ProblemNumber-ProblemTitle.cpp -o solution
    ```
4. Run the compiled solution:
    ```bash
    ./solution
    ```

## üèÖ Goal

The main goal of this repository is to practice and improve problem-solving skills by tackling LeetCode problems. By solving these problems, I aim to:

- Strengthen my grasp on algorithms and data structures.
- Prepare for coding interviews.
- Contribute to the coding community by sharing solutions.
